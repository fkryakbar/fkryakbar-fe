# Introduction

Manual test item analysis and paper-based exams are time-intensive processes for educators, often delaying feedback and hindering data-driven improvements. To empower teachers at the Mathematics Education Department of Universitas Lambung Mangkurat, I developed Anbusoâ€”a web-based platform that automates test item analytics and doubles as a real-time Computer-Based Testing (CBT) system. This dual-purpose tool streamlines exam creation, administration, and analysis, all within a single interface.

# Project Overview
- Role: Solo Developer (Full design, development, and deployment)
- Technologies: Laravel, Inertia.js (React), Tailwind CSS, MySQL, Docker (Nginx + PHP-FPM)

# The Problem & Purpose
Mathematics teachers faced two key challenges:
- Manual Item Analysis: Calculating metrics like validity and difficulty manually for hundreds of test items consumed hours of work.
- Disconnected CBT Tools: Existing CBT platforms lacked integrated analytics, forcing teachers to juggle multiple systems.
Anbuso solves these by:
- Automating statistical analysis for both multiple-choice and essay questions.
- Serving as a unified platform for creating exams, administering CBT sessions, and generating real-time insights.

# Key Features Developed
### Automated Test Item Analytics
- Multiple-Choice Analysis: Calculates difficulty index, discrimination power, distractor efficiency, and reliability.
- Essay Evaluation: Provides validity scoring based on rubric alignment.
- Instant Reports: Teachers export analysis results as Excel for accreditation or review.
### Real-Time Computer-Based Testing (CBT)
- Students take exams online with time limits and auto-submission.
- Live Progress Dashboard: Teachers monitor participation and scores in real time.
### User-Friendly Interface
- React-powered UI (via Inertia.js) allows seamless navigation between exam creation, analytics, and student monitoring.
- Tailwind CSS ensures responsive design across devices.
### Role-Based Access
- Teachers create exams and view analytics; students access only assigned tests.

# Technical Implementation
- Backend: Laravel manages exam logic, analytics calculations, and user roles.
- Frontend: Inertia.js bridges Laravel with React, enabling dynamic UIs without full-page reloads (e.g., live score updates).
- Database: MySQL stores exam questions, student responses, and analysis results.
- Deployment: Dockerized with Nginx and PHP-FPM for optimized performance and scalability.

# Outcome 
- Teachers now complete item analysis in minutes instead of days.
- Over 200+ users or teacher have been registered via Anbuso.
- The system has reduced post-exam feedback delays by 90%, enabling faster curriculum improvements.
