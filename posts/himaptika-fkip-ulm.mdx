# Website Project of the Mathematics Education Student Association at FKIP ULM

project of the website developed for the Mathematics Education Student Association at the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Lambung Mangkurat University (FKIP ULM). The website serves as a platform for publication, information dissemination, and as a medium for voicing aspirations. The development of the website utilizes Next.js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Laravel for the backend.

1. Background: The Mathematics Education Student Association at FKIP ULM recognizes the importance of establishing a strong online presence to effectively reach and engage its members, as well as the wider academic community. In line with this objective, a website project was initiated to create a dynamic platform that fulfills the association's communication and information-sharing needs.
2. Next.js: Powering the Frontend. Next.js, a popular JavaScript framework, was chosen for the frontend development of the website. Next.js provides several advantages, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing. These features ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining high performance and search engine optimization (SEO) benefits.
3. Tailwind CSS: Crafting Beautiful Styles. To achieve an appealing and modern design, Tailwind CSS was employed for styling the website. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-built components and utilities. It allows for efficient and flexible styling, empowering developers to create visually captivating interfaces with minimal effort.
4. Laravel: Empowering the Backend. Laravel, a PHP-based web framework, was chosen to handle the backend development of the website. With its elegant syntax, robust features, and extensive community support, Laravel simplifies the development process and ensures efficient data management and interaction. Its MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture facilitates clean code separation and enhances maintainability.
